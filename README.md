## Deployment instructions

The directory `/dist` contains all the built files which are ready to be deployed in their final location. This directory is the root directory of the site. Do not deploy anything but that directory.
Please double check that all the links and images are working correctly, as we are not able to fully test them without access to the production server.

## Newletter Email HTML

The html for the newsletter mailer is in the file `dist/2016_newsletter.html`. This can be sent as an HTML email. The link `/2016_newsletter.html` will allow viewing the mail in the browser.

## Making updates

All source files for the site are in the `/app` directory, and can be built using the gulp command `gulp`; You will need node, npm and gulp installed to do this.
